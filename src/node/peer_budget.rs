//! Per-link-peer token budget.
//!
//! A budget limits how fast one authenticated link peer may make this node do
//! something on its behalf. Every field of a datagram is chosen by whoever sent
//! it, so a per-destination or per-source gate can be escaped by varying the
//! field it is keyed on. The one value an attacker cannot mint is the
//! authenticated link peer the frame arrived from, whose cardinality is bounded
//! by the peer table and by admission. Each budget is keyed on it.
//!
//! The routing-error instance bounds induced routing-error emissions (a transit
//! node synthesizes CoordsRequired, PathBroken or MtuExceeded in response to a
//! datagram it could not forward). It is consulted ahead of any address-keyed
//! structure so that those structures only grow at the budget rate.
//!
//! The coordinate-hint instance pays for the coordinate-cache space a link
//! peer's hints take, in units of cache weight. A newly seen peer starts it
//! empty, so a fresh link identity buys nothing, and a peer that stays
//! connected keeps what it accrues while quiet. Its buckets are dropped when
//! their peer leaves the peer table ([`PeerBudget::sweep_departed`]).
