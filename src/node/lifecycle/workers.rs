//! Supervision of the crypto worker pools: what a pool that started short
//! means for the node, and the tick's sweep for workers that have since
//! exited.
//!
//! The pools are a performance offload, and Windows never starts them at
//! all, so losing workers is `Degraded` at most and never fatal. An outbound
//! packet for a missing encrypt worker is sealed on the main loop. Inbound
//! packets for a session already held by a missing decrypt worker are
//! dropped until the session rekeys or the link is re-established; a session
//! that would be registered on the missing worker after the loss is decrypted
//! on the main loop instead.
//! The pools report facts (how many workers, how many live); the decisions
//! below turn them into supervisor events.
