# Transport Statistics Reference

Per-transport statistics counter inventories. Counters are exposed
through the daemon control socket (`fipsctl show transports`) and the
`fipstop` operator UI. For the transport-layer design (services
provided to FMP, transport categories, the trait surface, connection
model), see
[../design/fips-transport-layer.md](../design/fips-transport-layer.md).

All transports report counters via `fipsctl show transports`; the
tables below are source-extracted from each transport's `stats.rs`
module.

## UDP

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `packets_sent` / `bytes_sent` | Successful sends |
| `packets_recv` / `bytes_recv` | Successful receives |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `mtu_exceeded` | Packets rejected for MTU violation |
| `kernel_drops` | Kernel `SO_RXQ_OVFL` drop count (feeds ECN congestion detection) |

## TCP

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `packets_sent` / `bytes_sent` | Successful sends |
| `packets_recv` / `bytes_recv` | Successful receives |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `mtu_exceeded` | Packets rejected for MTU violation |
| `connections_established` | Successful outbound connections |
| `connections_accepted` | Accepted inbound connections |
| `connections_rejected` | Rejected inbound connections (either limit exceeded) |
| `source_rejected` | Inbound connections rejected because their source (one IPv4 address or IPv6 /64) already held `max_inbound_per_source` connections; also counted in `connections_rejected` |
| `connect_timeouts` | Connection timeout count |
| `connect_refused` | Connection refused count |
| `pool_inbound` | Current inbound connections held in the connection pool (gauge) |
| `pool_outbound` | Current outbound connections held in the connection pool (gauge) |

## Ethernet

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `frames_sent` / `frames_recv` | Successful frame send/receive |
| `bytes_sent` / `bytes_recv` | Byte counters |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `beacons_sent` / `beacons_recv` | Peer-discovery beacon traffic |
| `beacons_dropped` | Received beacons the discovery buffer had no room for |
| `frames_too_short` | Frames below minimum length, dropped |
| `frames_too_long` | Frames above transport MTU, dropped |

## Tor

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `packets_sent` / `bytes_sent` | Successful sends |
| `packets_recv` / `bytes_recv` | Successful receives |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `connections_established` | Successful SOCKS5 connections |
| `connect_timeouts` | Connection timeout count |
| `connect_refused` | Connection refused count |
| `socks5_errors` | SOCKS5 protocol errors |
| `mtu_exceeded` | Packets rejected for MTU violation |
| `connections_accepted` | Accepted inbound connections via onion service |
| `connections_rejected` | Rejected inbound connections (limit exceeded) |
| `control_errors` | Tor control port errors |
| `pool_inbound` | Current inbound connections held in the connection pool (gauge) |
| `pool_outbound` | Current outbound connections held in the connection pool (gauge) |

## Nym

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `packets_sent` / `bytes_sent` | Successful sends |
| `packets_recv` / `bytes_recv` | Successful receives |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `mtu_exceeded` | Packets rejected for MTU violation |
| `connections_established` | Successful SOCKS5 connections through `nym-socks5-client` |
| `connect_timeouts` | Connection timeout count |
| `socks5_errors` | SOCKS5 protocol errors |

Nym is outbound-only (no inbound listener), so there are no
`connections_accepted` / `connections_rejected` counters.

## Bluetooth

| Counter | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `packets_sent` / `bytes_sent` | Successful L2CAP CoC sends |
| `packets_recv` / `bytes_recv` | Successful L2CAP CoC receives |
| `send_errors` / `recv_errors` | Send/receive failures |
| `mtu_exceeded` | Packets rejected for MTU violation |
| `connections_established` | Outbound L2CAP channels kept, including one held beside another |
| `connections_accepted` | Inbound L2CAP channels kept, including one held beside another |
| `connections_rejected` | Channels dropped because the pool was full and nothing could be evicted |
| `connect_timeouts` | Connection timeout count |
| `connect_errors` | Outbound connects that failed with an error rather than timing out |
| `pool_evictions` | Connection-pool entries evicted |
| `advertisements_sent` | BLE advertisements emitted |
| `scan_results` | BLE scan results observed |
| `duplicates_held` | Channels held beside another at the same address, as when two nodes dial each other at once |
| `duplicates_closed` | Channels retired because another at the same address was kept |
