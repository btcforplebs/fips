# ── Cases for check-glibc-floor.sh ──────────────────────────────────────────
# The floor check runs at release time, on artifacts nobody re-reads, so how it
# reports matters as much as what it finds. An input it cannot examine (a
# missing path, a file that is not an ELF object such as an unextracted
# tarball, a corrupt or binary-less .deb) must come out as "could not check"
# with exit 2, never as a binary above the floor: that advice sends the reader
# to rebuild a package that was never examined. A binary that really is above
# the floor must still exit 1 with the advice, even beside unchecked inputs. A
# floor that is missing or empty means the check cannot run at all, which is
# exit 2 as well.
#
# Inputs are built at run time from the host's own true executable (the first
# one on PATH). Every case either sets FIPS_GLIBC_FLOOR or runs a scratch copy
# of the check beside a build-floor.env of its own, so nothing depends on the
# host's glibc or on the repository's packaging/build-floor.env.
#
# Exit 0 = every case behaved. Exit 1 = a case did not. Exit 2 = the cases
# could not run (no readelf, no dpkg-deb, no dynamic true); never a pass.
