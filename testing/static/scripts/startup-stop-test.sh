# Start-up stop test: a stop sent while fips or fips-gateway is still starting
# is acted on, not lost.
#
# Each case runs one container from the test image, waits until the tested
# process is PID 1 and has logged its anchor line, then sends `docker stop` a
# fixed delay after the anchor. Before the exec in the entrypoint, PID 1 is
# bash, which has no SIGTERM handler, so a stop timed from container start
# would be discarded with or without the fix; the anchor rules that out. A
# missing anchor is a failure, never a skip.
#
# Cases:
#   daemon, stop inside the grace   start-up held about 5 s by one STUN server
#                                   that never answers; stopped 2 s after
#                                   start-up began, so start-up finishes after
#                                   the stop, then the daemon drains and exits 0
#   daemon, stop past the grace     three such servers, about 15 s; stopped
#                                   0.5 s in with a 10 s stop timeout, so the
#                                   daemon must give up at its 5 s grace and
#                                   exit 0 before Docker kills it
#   daemon, healthy stop            no Nostr; stopped 5 s after start-up ended
#   gateway, stop during the probe  fips-gateway as PID 1 probing a DNS upstream
#                                   that never answers; stopped 0.5 s in
#
# Configs reach the container with `docker cp` before it starts, so nothing
# here is a bind mount and the temporary directory never has to be visible to
# the Docker daemon.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/startup-stop-test.sh   (exit 0 all checks passed, 1 otherwise)
