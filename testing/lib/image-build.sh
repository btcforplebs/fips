# Shared helpers for building test images and starting test containers.
#
# Source this file to get dump_output(), run_quiet(), build_inline(),
# retry_build() and shared_tmpdir():
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/image-build.sh"
#   echo "$dockerfile" | run_quiet "docker build -t $tag" \
#       docker build -t "$tag" -f - "$REPO_ROOT"

#
# A build or a container start that fails for a reason outside the project,
# such as a registry timeout, is indistinguishable from one the project caused
# unless its output survives. dump_output and run_quiet keep a command quiet
# when it succeeds and print everything it said when it fails.
#
# Image builds reach Docker Hub, ghcr.io and distribution mirrors, and every one
# of those has timed out or served a truncated file in CI for a few seconds at a
# time. retry_build runs a whole build again after such a failure, so the base
# image is resolved again and each RUN step that fetched packages runs again.

# Emit a captured output file to stderr, delimited and labelled with the
# command it came from. Callers use this only on failure: a command that
# succeeds leaves no trace, so the suite stays quiet when it is green.

# Create a temporary directory that can be a bind-mount source, and print its
# path: shared_tmpdir [--sweep] ROOT NAME makes ROOT/NAME.XXXXXX.
#
# Use this, never a bare `mktemp -d`, for any directory or file that becomes a
# `docker run -v` source; testing/check-mount-tmpdir.py enforces it. A
# directory that stays on this side of the boundary, such as a build context
# the docker CLI reads itself, does not need it.
#
# A bind-mount source is resolved by the Docker daemon in the host's mount
# namespace, never in the caller's. Under a service sandbox that gives the unit
# a private /tmp -- systemd's PrivateTmp=, which the CI worker on the builder
# sets -- a path from `mktemp -d` exists only in the caller's namespace. The
# daemon finds nothing at it and creates an empty directory instead, so a
# socket the container binds lands where the caller cannot see it, a file the
# container writes is never read back, and a file mount such as fips.yaml
# arrives as a directory, which the daemon reports as EISDIR. None of these
# says what happened. The suites failed all three ways on the builder while
# passing on GitHub, whose runner has no such sandbox.
#
# So ROOT must be a path that resolves the same in both namespaces: the
# worktree (its target/ is ignored), or a directory that is already a mount
# source, such as a packaging script's output directory. The helper does not
# check where ROOT is, because a caller's --output-dir may legitimately be
# under /tmp on a host without a private /tmp; the guard instead refuses a
# literal /tmp or $TMPDIR root.
#
# NAME is the directory's prefix and carries any leading dot. --sweep first
# removes ROOT/NAME.* directories older than two hours, for a persistent ROOT
# whose earlier runs may have been killed before their own cleanup ran. Two
# hours is far above any run and far below the interval at which leftovers
# would pile up. The swept trees can hold files a container wrote as root, so
# a stale directory that cannot be removed is left alone silently: the sweep
# never prints and never decides the exit status. Do not sweep inside a
# per-run ROOT that the caller's own trap removes; there it gains nothing and
# could remove a live sibling in a run longer than two hours.
#
# Returns 2 for a bad argument, 1 if ROOT or the directory cannot be created.
