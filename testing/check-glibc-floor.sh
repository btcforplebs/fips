# Fail when a shipped binary needs a newer glibc than the declared floor.
#
# The defect this exists to catch installs cleanly and then cannot run. Rust's
# standard library references pidfd_spawnp and pidfd_getpid as weak undefined
# symbols guarded by a runtime check, so a binary is meant to fall back where
# the C library lacks them. Linking against a glibc that HAS them records a
# version dependency instead, and the loader refuses the whole image on that
# entry alone regardless of the symbols being weak. Every Linux artifact from
# v0.3.0 to v0.5.0 shipped that way and could not start on Debian 12 or Ubuntu
# 22.04, while apt reported success and fipsctl -- which never spawns a process
# and so never referenced those symbols -- ran perfectly.
#
# Usage: check-glibc-floor.sh <artifact|binary>...
#   A .deb is unpacked and every executable under usr/bin is checked.
#   Anything else is treated as a single ELF binary.
#
# Reads the floor from packaging/build-floor.env unless FIPS_GLIBC_FLOOR is set.
#
# Exit 0 = every input was examined and none is above the floor. Exit 1 = a
# binary needs a newer glibc than the floor. Exit 2 = an input could not be
# examined (missing, not an ELF object, a .deb that would not unpack or holds
# no binaries), or the check could not run at all; never treated as a pass,
# and never reported as a binary above the floor.
