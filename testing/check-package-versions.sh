# ── Package version derivation check ────────────────────────────────────────
# A release candidate is tagged vX.Y.Z-rcN, because git refuses '~' in a ref
# name. dpkg reads X.Y.Z-rcN as revision rcN of X.Y.Z and sorts it ABOVE the
# release, so a host that installed the candidate is never upgraded by the
# release. package-linux.yml's "Derive Linux package version" step therefore
# maps the tag's pre-release suffix to '~' for the .deb, which dpkg sorts below.
#
# This runs that step's own text, taken from the workflow, rather than a copy,
# so the check and the workflow cannot drift apart.
#
# Debian cases:
#   refs/tags/v0.5.3      both versions 0.5.3
#   refs/tags/v0.5.3-rc1  deb 0.5.3~rc1, tarball and artifact 0.5.3-rc1, and
#                         dpkg orders 0.5.2 < 0.5.3~rc1 < 0.5.3
#   refs/heads/maint      deb equals the tarball version, which is
#                         <Cargo version>+maint.<height>.<hash>
#
# It also checks the wiring the derivation needs to have any effect: the job
# declares the deb_package_version output, the .deb build passes it as
# --version, and that step renames a '~' in the package file name to '-' (a
# GitHub release renames an asset with special characters in its name, which
# would leave checksums-linux.txt naming a file the release does not have).
# Those three are read from the text, not executed.
#
# OpenWrt's opkg compares versions with dpkg's algorithm (libopkg/pkg.c
# verrevcmp in openwrt/opkg-lede, read at 80503d94) and splits a revision at
# the last '-', so the .ipk has the same defect. package-openwrt.yml's "Derive
# package version" step maps the tag for the .ipk control Version, keeping the
# leading 'v' every released .ipk carries: under opkg, 0.5.4 sorts below
# v0.5.3, so dropping it would stop releases upgrading. dpkg stands in for
# opkg as the ordering oracle; it warns about the 'v' and still compares.
#
# ipk cases:
#   refs/tags/v0.5.3      package_version and ipk_version v0.5.3
#   refs/tags/v0.5.3-rc1  ipk_version v0.5.3~rc1, package_version (the file
#                         label) v0.5.3-rc1, and v0.5.2 < v0.5.3~rc1 < v0.5.3
#                         < v0.5.4
#   refs/tags/v0.5.3-beta1  ipk_version v0.5.3~beta1, which sorts between
#                         v0.5.2 and v0.5.3~rc1
#   refs/heads/maint      ipk_version equals package_version
# and the wiring: the job declares ipk_version, and the "Build .ipk" step
# passes it as IPK_VERSION. build-ipk.sh's use of IPK_VERSION is executed by
# testing/openwrt/package-test.sh.
#
# Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = a case or a wiring check failed, including a
# derivation that ran but did not write a declared output. Exit 2 = the check
# could not run (no dpkg, no PyYAML, a step not found, the derivation failed,
# or dpkg could not compare); never treated as a pass.
