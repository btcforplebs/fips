"""Fail when a bare `mktemp` result can become a `docker run` bind-mount source.

A bind-mount source is resolved by the Docker daemon in the host's mount
namespace, never in the caller's. Where the caller runs with a private /tmp
(systemd's PrivateTmp=, which the builder's CI worker sets), a directory from
a bare `mktemp -d` exists only for the caller: the daemon creates an empty one
at the same path on the host, and the container and the script then work in
two different directories without either saying so. A mounted `mktemp` file
fails the same way and arrives as a directory. Nothing on GitHub's runners
shows it, so without this check the first sign is a builder run that fails
for no visible reason.

The one sanctioned way to make such a directory is `shared_tmpdir ROOT NAME`
in testing/lib/image-build.sh, whose doc comment explains how to pick ROOT.

What is read: in sweep mode (no arguments), the files committed at HEAD that
are `*.sh`, `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `*.yaml`, or start with an sh or bash
shebang. File arguments replace the sweep and are read from disk, which is
how the check is tested against uncommitted copies.

Lines whose first non-blank character is `#` are skipped, a trailing comment
is ignored, and backslash continuations are joined; a finding names the
physical line of the match inside the joined line, and a marker is read from
that same line.

A bind-mount source is the shell word after a `-v` or `--volume` token,
quotes included, that (after one leading quote) begins with `$` and contains
`:/`; or a `--mount` with `type=bind` whose `source=` or `src=` begins with
`$`. The rules, per file:

  1. a mount source whose variable was assigned from a command substitution
     holding `mktemp` (directory or file), or from a function defined in the
     same file whose body holds one, directly or through assignments that
     name a tainted variable;
  2. in a file with any mount source, every `mktemp -d` (any short-option
     cluster holding `d`, or `--directory`) not marked on its line with
     `# mount-tmpdir: <reason>`. This covers sources reached through function
     arguments and loop variables, which rule 1 does not follow. A `mktemp`
     inside a quoted string that opens and closes on the same line, and is
     not inside a `$(...)` or backtick substitution there, is text such as an
     error message, not a command, and is not counted;
  3. a mount source made inline by `$(mktemp ...)`;
  4. a definition of `shared_tmpdir` anywhere but testing/lib/image-build.sh;
  5. a `shared_tmpdir` call whose ROOT literally starts with /tmp, /var/tmp
     or $TMPDIR.

testing/lib/image-build.sh is exempt from rules 1, 2, 3 and 5: it is the one
producer and has no mounts.

Before reading anything, the check runs a self-test: planted cases for every
rule and for the shapes that must not be flagged, and the helper itself (from
HEAD in sweep mode, from beside this file in file mode) run through bash
against a temporary directory. A wrong verdict there exits 2, so a run that
passes has also shown that it can fail.

Known gaps, recorded rather than discovered: rule 2 is per file, so a
directory made in one file and mounted by a script in another is not seen;
rule 5 reads only a literal ROOT, so `R=/tmp; shared_tmpdir "$R" x` passes;
Python `tempfile` in a script that mounts is not read; compose `volumes:`
entries are not read; mount flags carried in an unquoted variable
(`m="-v $d:/x"; docker run $m`) and a source joined to its flag with no space
(`-v"$d:/x"`) are not seen as mounts, so they neither trigger rule 1 nor make
the file one that rule 2 reads; a quoted string spanning several lines, such
as a multi-line `bash -c '...'` script, is read line by line as if unquoted,
so a `mktemp -d` inside one still counts for rule 2; run as root, the
self-test's unremovable-directory case is removable and so does not exercise
the failure it targets. GitHub CI does not run this check yet; local CI does.

Exit codes:
    0 - nothing flagged
    1 - at least one finding; every one is printed
    2 - the check could not run (not a git work tree, git failed, no files,
        bash missing, or a self-test verdict was wrong); never a pass
